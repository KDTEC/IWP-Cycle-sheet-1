            <h2 id="1">The wicket-keeper in the sport of cricket is the player on the fielding side who stands behind the wicket or stumps being watchful of the batsman and ready to take a catch, stump the batsman out and run out a batsman when occasion arises</h2>
            <h2 id="2">In cricket, a slip fielder is placed behind the batter on the off side of the field. They are placed with the aim of catching an edged ball which is beyond the wicket-keeper's reach.</h2>
            <h2 id="3">Gully is in the game is when a batsman is cutting off the back foot. If the ball is mishit a catch is on. If it is played down the gully is there to save the boundary with a reaction stop, often requiring a dive. </h2>
            <h2 id="4">They'll be located square of the wicket on the off-side and have the responsibility of stopping forceful shots played off the back foot like the square cut.</h2>
            <h2 id="5">It's another very busy area on the off-side to be fielding in and the better fielders will be found in this position. The main aim in the covers is to stop the runs coming from the batsman driving off the front or back foot.</h2>
            <h2 id="6">You will find the third man positioned behind the wicketkeeper on the off-side. The fielder is usually 45 degrees to the wicket around on the boundary. It covers a large area - anything that goes through the slip and gully area.</h2>
            <h2 id="7">This is usually an area where bowlers hope to get a bit of rest between overs. The position is on the leg side at around 45 degrees to the wicket.</h2>
            <h2 id="8">This is positioned on the leg side, between square leg and mid-on. It is roughly between 45-60 degrees from the bat. It is another position where run-saving is the main aim, rather than attacking the batsmen.</h2>
            <h2 id="9">Mid-off is normally positioned about 25-30 yards from the batsman, while silly mid-off is in close to the batsman looking for bat-pad chances.</h2>
            <h2 id="1s">The position of a fielder on the left of the batsman and almost on the opposite side of the wicket. the fielder occupying this position.</h2>
